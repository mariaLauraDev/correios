# Improving the Correios system

## About ‚ùì

The problem situation consisted of improving two points in the architecture and writing of the current Correios codes. The first point of improvement is in the persistence layer. Currently, they work with a Repository class for each application entity. The second point is the delivery mode calculation mechanism. Also, there is a class that manages these calculations in a single method, with some ifs. They think that in the future this can cause problems, because today all these rules are in a single class, making maintenance difficult. This project desires to solve these two problem situations with object-oriented programming concepts.
